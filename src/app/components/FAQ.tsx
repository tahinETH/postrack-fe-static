  {
    question: "What is Postrack?",
    answer:
      "Postrack goes beyond basic analytics to reveal why content succeeds or fails. " +
      "Postrack tracks granular first-hour engagement patterns invisible to Twitter Analytics, then provide AI-powered strategies to replicate viral moments and avoid dead-end posts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this better than Twitter Analytics?",
    answer:
      "Twitter shows you what happened. Postrack shows you why it happenedâ€”and how to make it happen again. For not only your account but any public account or post. " +
      "Track granular first-hour metrics Twitter doesn't surface: early verified engagement velocity, reply sentiment shifts, amplifier quality scoring.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I analyze accounts I don't own?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Postrack works for any public Twitter account or post. Track influencers in your niche and monitor competitors' campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does real-time tracking work?",
    answer:
      "Our system captures fresh metrics every 5 minutes during the critical first hour, tracking elements Twitter ignores " +
      "like verified engagement velocity and reply sentiment shifts. After the first hour, Postrack continues monitoring at 30-minute intervals. " +
      "We store this granular data to show you exactly when and why posts gain traction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Postrack access historical data?",
    answer:
      "Postrack begins tracking from the moment you submit an account or post. We cannot access data from before submission. " +
      "However, if the account or post you're interested in is already being tracked in our system (because someone else submitted it), " +
      "you'll automatically see all the historical data we've collected since it was first added to our platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to connect my Twitter account?",
    answer:
      "Monitoring public posts requires no login, but connecting your Twitter account unlocks live alerts, AI rescue tactics, " +
      "and protected content analysis. Full access requires OAuth verification through Twitter's API.",
  },
  {
    question: "Free vs. Pro: What's the difference?",
    answer:
      "Free users get basic metrics for one post. Paid unlocks multi-post tracking, first-hour analytics, real-time rescue alerts, " +
      "amplifier quality scores, and our full suite of AI optimization tactics.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track multiple accounts?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Manage unlimited Twitter profiles in one dashboard with separate performance dashboards. " +
      "Agencies love our multi-client support for coordinating rescue campaigns across accounts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of AI-driven insights do you provide?",
    answer:
      "Our AI analyzes engagement patterns to suggest viral replication strategies and emergency fixes. " +
      "You'll get automatic rescue playbooks for failing posts, amplifier targeting lists, and ideal posting schedules tailored to your audience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Be tracking in 90 seconds: sign up, paste any Twitter post URL, and see your first analysis within 5 minutes. " +
      "Connect your own handle for full algorithm-decoding capabilities.",
  },
